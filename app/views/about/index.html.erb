            <h3>Work Experiance</h3>
            <div class ="about_page-div-grey">
                <p>My last job title was Technical Support Specialist for a credit card processing company that was based in Manhattan, New York but they had merchants from all over America.
                   I was hired to programmed credit card terminals and ship them to merchants, courtesy call the merchants after shipping the terminal and assisted them through the installation process.
                   After a few months, I started assisting with business relations by networking with businesses and requesting information regarding their software,  hardware, and reseller programs.
                   After a year and a half, I was promoted to the Web Project Manager as well as the Marketing Project Manager. I worked on improving brand consistency throughout the website design 
                   as well as in their online presence, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Yelp. I also helped ptimizing the front-end web application for user-friendly about_pages that maximum speed, 
                   scalability, and SEO.

            <div class="about_page-div-grey">
            <p>I am the kind of person that enjoys the little details of life, from the chilly wind on a hot summer day to the male cardinal that my brothers call Mr. C, singing early in the morning. I call
            these moments “picture-perfect moments”, and these are the moments I try capturing through my art. I try my best to capture the moment and bring the beauty of the moment to life for others. 
            Through art, I am able to express myself without words and yet communicate with people from all around the world. I will continuously be working on the Art-Page, where you can take a virtual 
            ture of my art portfolio.  </p>
